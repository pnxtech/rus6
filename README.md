Redis Microservice Module

This repository is the project home for an experimental [Redis module](https://redis.io/topics/modules-intro) based on the [Hydra Microservice Library](https://github.com/pnxtech/hydra).

The primary goal of this project is to enable the cross-platform construction of microservices by leveraging the power of Redis.

The loadable Redis module closely follows the use of Redis presented in my talk at [RedisConf 18](https://youtu.be/z25CPqJMFUk) and in this [medium post](https://medium.com/hydramicroservices/building-light-weight-microservices-using-redis-dc5b3bca741).
